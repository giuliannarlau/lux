                <li>If your project meets its funding goal by the deadline, the platform's admin account will transfer the collected lumens (XLM) to you.</li>
                <li>Should the project not reach its goal, all funds will be returned to the backers, ensuring a risk-free contribution.</li>
              </ol>

            <div class="item-description">
              Making a donation to projects on our platform is straightforward. Follow these steps to support your chosen project:
              <ol>
                <li>First, make sure your Freighter wallet is connected to our platform. This is essential for processing your donation.</li>
                <li>Navigate to the projects page, where you can search by category, status, or name, and click on the chosen project.</li>
                <li>Enter the amount you wish to donate in the designated field on the project's specific page.</li>
                <li>Click the 'Donate' button. The Freighter extension will then prompt you for confirmation and your password.</li>
                <li>Once your donation is processed, you will receive a confirmation hash.</li>
              </ol>
              If the project does not reach its funding goal, your donation will be refunded.
              To view and keep track of all your donations, click on 'My Account' on the navigation bar and select the 'My Donations' option.

            <div class="list-group-title">How the admin account works?</div>
            <div class="item-description">
              The admin account funds and refunds projects after they expire:
              <ol>
                <li>Make sure you have inserted an admin public key in the .env file.</li>
                <li>After connecting your admin account wallet, go to the 'Control Panel' page, which can only be accessed by the admin account.</li>
                <li>Check the boxes of the projects to fund or refund and click on the respective button.</li>
                <li>Upon action, a transaction is constructed and displayed in a new modal. Once confirmed, the Freighter extension is activated to sign the transaction.</li>
                <li>The projects will have their status updated and can be seen on the 'All' tab from the Control Panel page.</li>
              </ol>
              The admin account is restricted from donating to or launching its own projects. Attempts to do so will redirect the user to the 'Control Panel' page.

          <li class="list-group-item">
            <div class="list-group-title">How the transactions work?</div>
            <div class="item-description">
              Each Stellar transaction can include one or more operations.
              Lux is configured so that a donation constitutes a single operation within a transaction.
              However, when the admin funds or refunds multiple projects, a transaction may contain one or more operations, depending on the number of projects involved.

          <li class="list-group-item">
            <div class="list-group-title">How the projects updates work?</div>
            <div class="item-description">
              Every time someone runs the program, the status of expired projects is updated accordingly: to
              <span class="text-orange">'fund'</span> if the project reached its goal amount, to
              <span class="text-orange">'refund'</span> if it received donations but did not reach the final goal, and to
              <span class="text-orange">'unsuccessful'</span> if it did not receive any donations.
              <!--TODO: After the admin account fund or refund projects the statuses are updated to 'successful' or 'unsuccessful' respectively.-->
              All the transactions and projects save instantly on a local database.

            <div class="item-description">
              Yes, you can cancel your project directly from its page, but this action is irreversible.
              Any received donations will be refunded to doners, and your project's status will be updated to 'refund',
              otherwise the status will change to 'unsuccessful'.

            <div class="list-group-title">How do I run and test this project?</div>
            <div class="item-description">
              You can run it locally. To start a project or make a donation, you need to create
              and fund a Freighter wallet first. To test the admin account, you need to add the 
              public key into the configuration file. Check out the READ ME to learn how.
